\section{Software Development Experience}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\square$}
\item For A-Level Computer Science coursework I created a primitive chess engine with VB.NET for the college chess club.
\item During the first year of my degree I completed various assignment exercises to gain experience with C, ARM asm, Java and Haskell.
\item I created a film database website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL for the coursework in the databases and interfaces module in year 1 of my degree. I now maintain raygarner.co.uk as a portfolio using skills I learned from that project.
\item For the first group work module of my degree, me and my team created JUnit tests to debug a faulty finance management app. We used git for version control during this project.
\item During the UK summer lockdown of 2020, I wrote a more advanced chess engine in Haskell with a friend I met at university. I later wrote an alternative version of the same program in C to allow it to make it's moves faster.
\item I have written shell scripts to automate the installation and configuration of Arch Linux to my preferences and also to create a multi-track recording tool wrapper for ffmpeg and mpv.
