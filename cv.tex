\section{Personal Profile}
I chose to study Computer Science because I find the work of software engineers like John Carmack and Linus Torvalds highly inspiring and also because I find programming exercises my imagination in a unique way.
Developing software gives me a similar sense of satisfaction as composing music does, a prolific hobby of mine.
Along with composing music, I have enjoyed playing in a variety of musical ensembles for several years now. 
This experience gave me the opportunity to practice my teamwork skills and creativity to a great extent, which quickly became useful during the group work project in the first year of my degree studies.
