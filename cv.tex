\item Wrote JUnit tests to debug a faulty finance app in the first group work module of my degree and also used git for version control
\item Programmed a more advanced chess engine in Haskell with a university colleague during the UK summer lockdown of 2020 and later developed a faster version of the program using C
\item Developed shell scripts to automate the installation and configuration of Arch Linux to my preferences
