\section{Education and Qualifications}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\square$}
\item Studying Computer Science BSc at the University of Nottingham in second year
\item Attained a 1st with 87\% overall in the first year of university
\item Achieved A, A, B in A-Level Computer Science, Music Technology and Music through Wigston College
\item Passed RSL Grade 8 electric guitar with merit

\end{itemize}

\section{Personal Profile}
I chose to study Computer Science because I find the work of software engineers like John Carmack and Linus Torvalds highly inspiring and also because I find programming exercises my imagination in a unique way.
Developing software gives me a similar sense of satisfaction as composing music does, a prolific hobby of mine.
Along with composing music, I have enjoyed playing in a variety of musical ensembles for several years now. 
This experience gave me the opportunity to practice my teamwork skills and creativity to a great extent, which quickly became useful during the group work module in the first year of my degree studies.

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\square$}

\item Created a shell script wrapper for mpv and ffmpeg to create a multi-track recording tool
\item Programmed a chess engine in Haskell using an alpha-beta search with a university colleague and later developed a faster version of the program in C
\item Developed shell scripts to automate the installation and configuration of Arch Linux to my preferences 
\item Set up a film database website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL for the coursework in the databases and interfaces module in year one of my degree. I now maintain raygarner.co.uk as a portfolio using skills I learned during that project
\item Wrote JUnit tests to debug a faulty finance app in the first group work module of my degree and also used git for version control
\item Utilised the Java GUI library ``swing" and object oriented programming techniques to create a Minesweeper game as a university assignment
\item Completed various assignment exercises to gain experience with C, ARM asm, Java and Haskell during the first year of my degree
\item Created a primitive chess engine using VB.NET for A-Level Computer Science coursework for the college chess club
